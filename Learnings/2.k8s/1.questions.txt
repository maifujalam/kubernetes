1. How to get cluster domain name?
   a. ssh into any pod ( ex.nginx pod deployed in default ns)
   b. k -n kube-system exec -it nginx-deployment-845d4d9dff-dn7q2 sh
   c. cat /etc/resolv.conf
   d. nameserver 10.96.0.10
      search default.svc.cluster.local svc.cluster.local cluster.local
      options ndots:5
   e. domain name is: cluster.local

   OR
   a. cat /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml

2. Difference between rc and rs?
    RC=>
    0.its predecessor, only used to creat replicas.
    1. Its have equality based selector,i.e; pass key:value for sector.(don't add matchLabels)
    2. It doesn't include existing matched label selector in replica count of itself.
    3. It is not created by deployment.

    RS=>
    0. it is advance then rc.
    1. It have set based selector,i.e matchLabels and matchExpressions.
    2. Include existing pods in count if label sector matches.
    3. it is created by deployment.

3. Delete repica set without deleting pods.
   k delete rs nginx-rs --cascade=orphan

4. Show logs of all containers in pods with timestamp.
    k logs -f network-debug-8j5x6 --all-containers --timestamps=true

5. What happens in background when we run kubectl command?
    1.loads kubeconfig for cluster authentication.(precedence => cli flag(--kubeconfig),environment variable(KUBECONFIG),path (~/.kube/config)
    2. goes to api server (with loaded client certificate)
    3. API server matches CNAME and then ready to validate ertificate.
    4. after authonticated ,it authorizes
    5. go to etcd cluster to get cluster data
    6. return
6. connect pods in different namespace?
    using service name.example.=> service.namespace

7. kubernetes all ports:-
    api-server: 6443
    kubelet- 10248
    kube-proxy- 10249
    kube-controller: 10257
    kube-scheduler:- 10259
    etcd:- 2379-2380

8. Different types of k8s services.
    a. clusterIP: default,
    b. Node port: range-30,000-32,767
    c. Load Balancer:- depends upon cloud provider
    e. External:-

9. What is the default image pull policy of deployment?
   Always:- so it always pull image.But if that image is still present in machine,then also it run docker pull at backend.

10. What is ingress?
    It a way to expose HTTP/HTTPS traffic to outside of cluster.It forward traffic to clusterIP.It have host based and path based routing.

11. What is host based and path routing?
    Routes the traffic to different hosts based on the host prefix:- app1.example.com,app2.example.com
    Routes trrafic according to path:- example:- example.com/app1,example.com/app2.

12. Can we implement ingress by creating Ingress object only?
    No,It needs ingress controller.Most famous is nginx-ingress controller.

13. Difference between kubeproxy and kubectl proxy?
    kubeproxy:- it purpose is to mainatin route table on each node for pod network connectivity.
    kubectl proxy:- its creats a proxy tunnel between k8s cluster and the host running k8s.Alternative to LB.
